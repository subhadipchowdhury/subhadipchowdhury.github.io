- Title: Collaborative Learning in Undergraduate Mathematics
  Location: University of Chicago Math Pedagogy Seminar
  Website: https://math.uchicago.edu/~pedagogyseminar/
  Duration: Winter 2024
  NUtshell: x-collab-learning
  Abstract: We will be discussing the five vital elements for productive cooperation in the classroom (following Johnson & Johnson, '98), obstacles for their practical implementation, and concrete strategies that work. Besides implementation, we will also talk about how to assess the success of a chosen strategy. I will be soliciting ideas from the attendees to personalize the suggestions in the context of undergraduate Math courses at UChicago.
