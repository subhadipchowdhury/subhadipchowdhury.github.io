- Title: Collaborative Learning in Undergraduate Mathematics
  Location: University of Chicago Math Pedagogy Seminar
  Website: https://math.uchicago.edu/~pedagogyseminar/
  Duration: Winter 2024
  Nutshell: x-collab-learning
  Abstract: We will be discussing the five vital elements for productive cooperation in the classroom (following Johnson & Johnson, '98), obstacles for their practical implementation, and concrete strategies that work. Besides implementation, we will also talk about how to assess the success of a chosen strategy. I will be soliciting ideas from the attendees to personalize the suggestions in the context of undergraduate Math courses at UChicago.

- Title: Techniques Grading in an IBL-style Intro to Proofs Course
  Location: Project NExT session on Re-Imagining Grading - The Whys and Hows
  Website: 
  Duration: Mar 2022 (rescheduled from Joint Mathematics Meetings 2022)
  Nutshell: x-project_next
  Abstract: In this session, I will talk about my reasoning, implementation, and experiences with using Techniques grading - a variant of MBG where (proof) techniques replace standards or specifications - in my Introduction to Proofs course. I will discuss my attempts at combining the system with an IBL course, how different types of assignments were assessed, and how I believe it helped to facilitate studentsâ€™ transition into the correct mindset for future proofs-intensive courses.
