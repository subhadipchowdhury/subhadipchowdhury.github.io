- Title: Understanding Intellectual Growth - Applying Perry's Scheme to Support Metacognition
  Location: University of Chicago Math Pedagogy Seminar
  Website: https://math.uchicago.edu/~pedagogyseminar/
  Duration: Autumn 2024
  Nutshell: x-perry
  Abstract: As educators, we understand that guiding students' intellectual growth goes beyond delivering content—it involves nurturing their ability to reflect on how they learn. Yet, metacognition doesn’t come naturally for many students, especially when they hold unspoken beliefs about knowledge and their roles in the classroom that limit their engagement. Perry’s scheme of intellectual development offers a framework for identifying these beliefs, which helps us pinpoint students’ positions in their learning journey. In this seminar, we will discuss how recognizing these stages can inform our teaching strategies and enable us to foster metacognitive growth more effectively. We’ll conclude with an interactive classification of effective classroom practices, aligning them with different levels of Perry's scheme!

- Title: Collaborative Learning in Undergraduate Mathematics
  Location: University of Chicago Math Pedagogy Seminar
  Website: https://math.uchicago.edu/~pedagogyseminar/
  Duration: Winter 2024
  Nutshell: x-collab-learning
  Abstract: We will be discussing the five vital elements for productive cooperation in the classroom (following Johnson & Johnson, '98), obstacles for their practical implementation, and concrete strategies that work. Besides implementation, we will also talk about how to assess the success of a chosen strategy. I will be soliciting ideas from the attendees to personalize the suggestions in the context of undergraduate Math courses at UChicago.

- Title: Techniques Grading in an IBL-style Intro to Proofs Course
  Location: Project NExT session on Re-Imagining Grading - The Whys and Hows
  Website: 
  Duration: Mar 2022 (rescheduled from Joint Mathematics Meetings 2022)
  Nutshell: x-project_next
  Abstract: In this session, I will talk about my reasoning, implementation, and experiences with using Techniques grading - a variant of MBG where (proof) techniques replace standards or specifications - in my Introduction to Proofs course. I will discuss my attempts at combining the system with an IBL course, how different types of assignments were assessed, and how I believe it helped to facilitate students’ transition into the correct mindset for future proofs-intensive courses.
