<h2>General Policy:</h2>
<h4> Homework </h4>
<ul>
<li>Homework is to be turned in on the given date at the BEGINNING of the class. Usually an assignment will be set in every class and will be due ONCE a week. 
<li> <b>Please STAPLE the work you're turning in if you want it to be read. Folding the corner over doesn't count. </b> Messy, mutilated or illegible homework will NOT be graded.
<li>Usually, Wednesday and Friday and (next week)Monday's homework are due on (next week)Friday.
<li>The point of the homework is for you to work out what you do and don't understand. You should help each other to understand things and come and ask me if a whole group of you gets really stuck together. When your homework has been handed back to you, you should go through it and see if you understand what has been written on it by the grader. If you don't, you should come to office hours and ask.
<li>I encourage you to work together on homework, but you should make sure you understand what you have written down. If you write up what was done in a group without understanding it, that counts as cheating.
<li>Late submission for homeworks will not be accepted unless in extreme circumstances.
</ul>

<h4>Office hours and Problem Sessions</h4>
Please use office hours wisely. It is best to discuss problems with others in the class first, and come to ask in a group if you're all stuck. Note that Problem sessions are for discussing new examples only, not done in class or assigned in homework.


<h4>Grading</h4>
Apart from homework, there will be <b>n</b> in-class quizzes, two midterms, and a final exam. The quiz will be on Friday at the end of class.

Here is how I will <b>roughly</b> weigh the tests, homeworks and quizzes:
<ul>
<li>Homework: 10% total
<li>Quizzes: About 10% total
<li>Midterm 1: About 20%
<li>Midterm 2: About 25%
<li>Final Exam: At least 35%
</ul>
<!--
<h4>Tutorial Sessions</h4>
Tuesday and Thursdays are tutorial sessions.<br>
<ul>
<li> Tuesday -  Discussion of the homework problems and/or more examples.
<li> Thursday - Quiz during tutorial (~20 mins) and normal discussion. <br>
Quiz will be based on syllabus covered. I will make up problems of my own. As such they might resemble homework problems but usually will not be from HW directly.
</ul>
-->
<hr>

<h2>Important Dates:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Midterm 1: Friday of week 4, October 20, 11:30AM-12:20PM
<li>Midterm 2: Wednesday of week 8, November 15, 11:30AM-12:20PM
<li>Final Exam: Monday, December 4, 10:30AM-12:30PM
</ul>

<div class="boxed">
<b>It is the policy of the Department of Mathematics that the following rules apply to final exams in all undergraduate mathematics courses:</b>
<ol>
<li><b>The final exam must occur at the time and place designated on the College Final Exam Schedule.</b> In particular, <b>NO</b> final examinations may be given during the tenth week of the quarter, except in the case of graduating seniors.
<li> Instructors are not permitted to excuse students from the scheduled time of the final exam except in the cases of an Incomplete.
</ol>
</div>
<hr>

<h2>Miscellaneous Items of Interest:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Incompletes are rarely given, and are mainly for cases of medical emergency or extreme personal tragedy. 
<li>I will almost never give a make-up exam.
<!--<li>There will be 17 lectures in total in this quarter. The last lecture time slot is reserved for the final exam.-->
<li>There will be no class the Friday after Thanksgiving.
<li>The first Sunday in November will have daylight savings time change.
</ul>
