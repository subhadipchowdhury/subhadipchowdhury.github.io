## General Policy

### Homework

* Homework is to be turned in on the given date at the BEGINNING of the class. Usually an assignment will be set in every class and will be due ONCE a week.
* Please STAPLE the work you're turning in if you want it to be read. Folding the corner over doesn't count. Messy, mutilated or illegible homework will NOT be graded.
* Usually, Wednesday and Friday and (next week) Monday's homework are due on (next week) Friday.
* The point of the homework is for you to work out what you do and don't understand. You should help each other to understand things and come and ask me if a whole group of you gets really stuck together. When your homework has been handed back to you, you should go through it and see if you understand what has been written on it by the grader. If you don't, you should come to office hours and ask.
* I encourage you to work together on homework, but you should make sure you understand what you have written down. If you write up what was done in a group without understanding it, that counts as cheating.
* Late submission for homeworks will not be accepted unless in extreme circumstances.

### Office hours and Problem Sessions

Please use office hours wisely. It is best to discuss problems with others in the class first, and come to ask in a group if you're all stuck. Note that Problem sessions are for discussing new examples only, not done in class or assigned in homework.

### Grading

Apart from homework, there will be `n` in-class quizzes, two midterms, and a final exam. The quiz will usually be on Friday at the end of class. Your score at the end of the quarter will be determined as follows:


+ Homework: 10% total
+ Quizzes: About 10% total
+ Midterm 1: About 20%
+ Midterm 2: About 25%
+ Final Exam: At least 35%
