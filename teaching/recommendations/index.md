If you are considering asking me for a letter, please read the following information carefully, and in its entirety. I want to encourage students to pursue further academic study, apply for scholarships, REUs, or summer internships, and find jobs, so I am happy to help by being a reference or writing a letter if you can follow the procedures below. Please provide me with these materials at least 4 weeks before your first recommendation is due. You can still ask for a letter if it is within 4 weeks, but I may not be able to honor requests that come at the last minute.

#### Follow the procedures below:

1. **Consider if I am the best choice to write this letter for you.** Do we know each other well enough for me to write something beyond "so-and-so got a good grade in my class"? Letters that say only that can actually do more harm than good.

2. **Give me Information.** If you do still want me to write you a letter, you should know that the key to effective recommendation letters is making them as detailed and specific as possible. I will write as many honest, specific, positive things as I possibly can based on my interactions with you. Nonetheless, you should consider giving me any other information that you think will help me write an even more detailed letter.

    - Send me an unofficial copy of your transcript and your CV or resume
        - List any academic honors earned at your institution
        - List any clubs, professional organizations, and volunteer activities.
    - Send me any essays/personal statements you are using for the application.
        
    Remember when you are writing your essay for whatever it is you are applying to, you are trying to sell yourself. Be personal, but also structure your letter to sell yourself. Feel free to send me any essays/CV/Resume/etc. if you would like some feedback on any of your materials.

3. **Please write a rough draft answering the questions below.** First, This will help you analyze if the schools, scholarships, or positions you are applying for are really a good match. Second, it gives me an idea of your self-perceived strengths. Third, it makes sure I don't miss anything you want me to talk about in your letter. 

    Do not feel like you need to be modest in your letter. Also, realize that I am not ``testing'' you with this task. You do not need to labor over your draft to impress me. You just need to write something honest that might be helpful as I write about you. 

    - What is your name, year/status in school, and field of study?
    - How long have I known you, and what is my relationship(s) to you? (instructor, advisor, colleague, etc.)
    - How would you describe yourself and what are your strengths?
    - What are your long term goals and how will this internship/position/award help you achieve them?
    - What makes you particularly qualified for this internship/position/award? 
        - If this is an REU, please provide information about the project/program you are applying to and why you are a great fit for it.

4. Please send me a single email containing all of the above documents and include a list of due dates or links to upload the letter/reference.
