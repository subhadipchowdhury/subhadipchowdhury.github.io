__Contents of this page will move to Moodle when the semester begins.__


### Course Time
Note that the course can be taken for a quarter credit. However, if you wish to just *‘show up’* for the meetings with no stakes, send me an email. I will only expect regular attendance from the students taking it for credit. The timing of the course is listed as Monday 3:00-3:50PM. However since it’s once a week, I am pretty flexible with the time as long as all the registered students agree on it.
 
### Course Goals
Officially the Math 27901 course is titled the Putnam Seminar. The Putnam is a challenging math competition administered to about 4000 undergraduates each year. The problems in the competition do not necessarily fall into typical categories covered by standard Math courses in college, and often challenge the students to think in innovative and creative ways. The course description for Math 279 in the college catalog can be paraphrased as “preparation for the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition”. However, I am here to tell you that it is much more than that. 

Unofficially, I like to think of this class as a “Problem Solving Seminar”. What kind of problems, you might ask? Anything that qualifies as a ‘logic’ or ‘math’ puzzle or question. So while we will use problems from previous Putnam exams as examples, we will also talk about how to set the correct mindset for solving ‘hard’ math problems in general. My aim is two-fold:
  * To realize that ‘solving a problem’ is not the same as ‘understanding the solution of a problem’. This in particular is important for both a student and a teacher, as you may often feel a disconnect between us regarding this very issue. After working out a solution (or if you know it beforehand), it may seem doable/easy in retrospect; but the hardest part often is how to start the solution. In fact, for a problem that usually appears in a competition such as Putnam (or the IMO), it isn’t often clear what, if any, theorem you learn during college is going to be needed. *So our aim during our meetings wouldn’t be trying to prove/list a bunch of theorems; but rather to discuss some strategies which would help us decide what part of Mathematics to use to “start” solving a problem* (for example, ‘trying the result in simpler cases’ or ‘drawing a picture’ or ‘shifting your perspective’ etc.)

  * To practice how to persevere with a difficult question, even when no goal might immediately be within your sights. This is the quintessential aspect of Mathematical scholarship. Whether you plan to go to grad school or industry after college, you will always face problems that are unknown to you. Your success will depend on whether, and how long you stick with it!

At this point, I will link two videos on two interesting problems from one of my favorite Math youtube channels below, which give perfect examples of how to “start” thinking about a hard problem. 
  * [The hardest problem on the hardest test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkmNXy7er84)
  * [The unexpectedly hard windmill question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M64HUIJFTZM)

You may want to watch these to get some motivation! 
 
### Learning Objectives 
Besides the Putnam Archive, we will be also using various problem-solving resources I have collected over the years, that will be linked through Moodle. You do not need to buy any book for this course, all you need is to have an inquisitive mindset. Here are some of the problem solving strategies I plan to cover in the weeks leading up to Putnam. I have also included some very easy sample problems to give you an idea of what I am talking about.
  * __The invariance principle__ – problems where a proof depends on finding a mathematical quantity (e.g. an algebraic expression) or a property (e.g. monotonicity, concavity, parity etc.)  that remains unchanged. 

__Sample problem:__ Start with an 8 × 8 chessboard with the usual coloring. In each move, you may repaint all squares of a 2 × 2 square (to the same color). The goal is to attain just one black square. Can you reach the goal?

  * __The Extremal principle__ – problems (usually a proof by contradiction) that utilizes the smallest or largest number (or element of a set) that has certain properties.

__Sample problem:__ Is there a smallest positive real number?

  * __Pigeon hole principle__ – A simple version can be stated as “if we put (n+1) pigeons into n holes, then at least 1 hole will have more than 1 pigeon”.

__Sample problem:__ What is the minimum number of student you need to ensure that at least three of them have birthday on the same day of the week?
  * __Popular Sequences and series__ – We are not proving convergence/divergence here. We will instead look at some famous sequence such as Fibonacci sequence, Chebyshev polynomials, etc. and learn how to utilize Mathematical Induction.

  * __Inequalities and Optimization__ – Inequalities show up in all fields of Math, both pure and applied, whenever we try to optimize a quantity. We will talk about AM-GM-HM, Cauchy-Schwartz, inequalities utilizing convex functions etc. Students who have taken multivariable will also be able to recognize optimizations using Lagrange multiplier.

  * __Modular arithmetic and Solving Diophantine equations__ – Existence problems which ask you to find some integers a,b,c (or prove that they can’t be found) satisfying a given equation. This often involves looking at the remainder of the terms when divided by some other number! 

__Sample problem:__ Find all pairs of prime numbers p and q such that p^2 = 2 q^2 + 1.

  * __Combinatorics leading to questions involving probability__ – This will involve some easy counting techniques.

### Course components
There are no exams or projects in this course. There might be occasional short reading exercises. The only expectation is that you will take the Putnam exam in December. Your grade (S/NC) will depend entirely on in-class attendance and participation.
 
### What's next?
Finally, even though the Putnam happens at the of Fall semester, I plan to continue having an unofficial “virtual problem solving seminar” in some form in spring semester. This wouldn’t be for credit, only for fun! This will probably devolve to something like one interesting problem posted online bi-weekly, with only online recognition as the prize! We will think about that over the semester as I gauge student interest.
