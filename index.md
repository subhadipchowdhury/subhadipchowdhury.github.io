## Teaching and Pedagogy

My pedagogical interests center on designing active, discovery-based, and inclusive learning environments that engage a diverse student body. My courses emphasize constructivist, project-based learning, and collaborative problem solving. A central focus of my recent work has been revising courses so that curriculum and assessment align with mastery-based and other alternate grading approaches, built around clear learning targets, carefully structured feedback loops, and meaningful opportunities for students to revise and improve their work.

Some ongoing teaching-related work includes:

- Coordinating our department’s Collaborative Learning tutorial program. This includes training and mentoring graduate TAs and undergraduate Lead Junior Tutors.
- Designing and facilitating professional development workshops for first-time Graduate Student Lecturers in mathematics.
- Using backward design to revise curricula in calculus and proof-based courses to align with alternate grading schemes.
- Designing materials and establishing norms for the responsible and transparent use of generative AI in mathematics courses.

**Pedagogy fellowships and grants.** During the 2025–2026 academic year, I will be an [Associate Pedagogy Fellow](https://teaching.uchicago.edu/programs/associate-pedagogy-fellows/) at the Chicago Center for Teaching and Learning. Previously, I served as a [Pedagogy Fellow](https://teaching.uchicago.edu/programs/pedagogy-fellows/) and co-led an [Exploratory Teaching Group](https://teaching.uchicago.edu/programs/exploratory-teaching-groups/) titled “Discussion on Implementing Alternate Grading and Redesigning Assessment in Math.”

**Materials from my current and past courses** are accessible through the [teaching page]({{ '/teaching/' | relative_url }}). Write-ups, slides, and resources related to collaborative learning, mastery-based grading, and AI-aware pedagogy will be posted on the [pedagogy page]({{ '/pedagogy/' | relative_url }}).

## Research Interests

My research background is in low-dimensional topological dynamics. I am especially interested in rigidity phenomena and self-similar structures that arise from nonabelian group actions on the circle. I have also contributed to the theory of formal languages, aiming to solve combinatorial group theory problems using topological methods.

More broadly, I am interested in topics related to geometric group theory, complex dynamics, and big mapping class groups. 

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Chicago under the direction of Prof. [Danny Calegari](http://math.uchicago.edu/~dannyc/). My papers and preprints are linked on my [research page](research).
