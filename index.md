## Research Interests

My primary research area is low-dimensional topological dynamics, especially the theory of nonabelian group actions on the circle. I have also made contributions to the theory of formal languages, with an aim to solve combinatorial group theory problems using topological methods. I am broadly interested in geometric group theory, complex dynamics, and big mapping class group related topics as well.

My papers and preprints are on my [research page](research).
