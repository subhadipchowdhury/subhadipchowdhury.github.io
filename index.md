## Curriculum Vitae
</div>

My CV is available [HERE](assets/CV.pdf). 

I will be joining [Bowdoin College](https://www.bowdoin.edu/) [Mathematics Department](https://www.bowdoin.edu/math/) as a Visiting Assistant Professor in Fall 2018.

I successfully defended my thesis on June 5, 2018 under the direction of Prof. [Danny Calegari](http://math.uchicago.edu/~dannyc/) and expect to receive my Ph.D. in August 2018. 

I received my Bachelor of Mathematics degree from [Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore Centre](http://www.isibang.ac.in/).

## Research Interests
</div>

My research area is low-dimensional dynamics and topology, specifically nonabelian actions of free groups on the circle via orientation preserving homeomorphisms. I am also interested in application of algebraic topology to formal language theory. I am broadly interested in Geometric Group Theory topics like stable commutator length and quasimorphisms as well.

My papers and preprints are on my [research page](research).
