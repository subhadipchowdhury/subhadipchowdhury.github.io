## Teaching and Pedagogy

My current pedagogical interests revolve around developing inquiry-based, collaborative, inclusive, and active learning in classroom that engages students from diverse backgrounds effectively. I also work on creating and implementing formative assessments and alternate grading techniques that reward growth and persistence.

During June 2024 - May 2025, I am supported by a <i>UChicago College Curricular Innovation Fund grant</i> to implement Collaborative Learning in the Mathematics department.

Course syllabi and lecture notes for my past courses are accessible through the [teaching page](teaching). The page also links to my philosophy statements and portfolio.

## Research Interests

My primary research area is low-dimensional topological dynamics, especially the theory of nonabelian group actions on the circle. I have also contributed to the theory of formal languages, aiming to solve combinatorial group theory problems using topological methods. I am broadly interested in topics related to geometric group theory, complex dynamics, and big mapping class groups. 

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Chicago under the direction of Prof. [Danny Calegari](http://math.uchicago.edu/~dannyc/). My papers and preprints are linked on my [research page](research).
