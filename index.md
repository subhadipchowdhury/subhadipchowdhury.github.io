## Teaching and Pedagogy

My pedagogical interests revolve around developing discovery-based, active, and inclusive learning environments that effectively engage students from diverse backgrounds and promote constructivist learning with a growth mindset. In my current role, I also advise the Neubauer Phoenix STEM scholars and train math undergraduate and graduate teaching assistants in the pedagogy and practice of collaborative learning. 

During academic year 2024-2025, I will be a [Pedagogy Fellow](https://teaching.uchicago.edu/programs/pedagogy-fellows-program) at the Chicago Center for Teaching and Learning, and I will be supported by a CCTL Grant to co-lead an [Exploratory Teaching Group](https://teaching.uchicago.edu/programs/exploratory-teaching-groups) titled "Discussion on Implementing Alternate Grading and Redesigning Assessment in Math".

Material from my past courses are accessible through the [teaching page](teaching). The page also links to my philosophy statements and portfolio.

## Research Interests

My background training is in low-dimensional topological dynamics, especially the theory of nonabelian group actions on the circle. I have also contributed to the theory of formal languages, aiming to solve combinatorial group theory problems using topological methods. I am broadly interested in topics related to geometric group theory, complex dynamics, and big mapping class groups. 

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Chicago under the direction of Prof. [Danny Calegari](http://math.uchicago.edu/~dannyc/). My papers and preprints are linked on my [research page](research).
