## Teaching and Pedagogy

My pedagogical interests revolve around designing discovery-based, active, and inclusive learning environments that engage diverse students effectively. My course design emphasizes constructivist project-based learning, and alternative grading systems with clear feedback loops for iterative improvement. I’m currently updating my courses and assignments to be more AI-aware and to promote responsible use of technology. I lead our department’s Collaborative Learning program and train graduate TAs and undergraduate Lead Junior Tutors. I also advise the Neubauer Phoenix STEM Scholars.

During academic year 2025-2026, I will be a [Associate Pedagogy Fellow](https://teaching.uchicago.edu/programs/associate-pedagogy-fellows) at the Chicago Center for Teaching and Learning. Last year, I was a [Pedagogy Fellow](https://teaching.uchicago.edu/programs/pedagogy-fellows-program) and was supported by a CCTL Grant to co-lead an [Exploratory Teaching Group](https://teaching.uchicago.edu/programs/exploratory-teaching-groups) titled "Discussion on Implementing Alternate Grading and Redesigning Assessment in Math".

Material from my current and past courses are accessible through the [teaching page](teaching).

## Research Interests

My background training is in low-dimensional topological dynamics, especially the theory of nonabelian group actions on the circle. I have also contributed to the theory of formal languages, aiming to solve combinatorial group theory problems using topological methods. I am broadly interested in topics related to geometric group theory, complex dynamics, and big mapping class groups.

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Chicago under the direction of Prof. [Danny Calegari](http://math.uchicago.edu/~dannyc/). My papers and preprints are linked on my [research page](research).
