## Research Interests

My research area is low-dimensional dynamics and topology, specifically nonabelian actions of free groups on the circle via orientation preserving homeomorphisms. I am also interested in application of algebraic topology to formal language theory. I am broadly interested in Geometric Group Theory topics like stable commutator length and quasimorphisms as well.

My papers and preprints are on my [research page](research).
